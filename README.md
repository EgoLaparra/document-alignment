# Title-Alignment

In title_alignment_classifier.py file , I train a logistic regression classifier on Ted dataset, which contains a list
of 1161â€¬ projects and, for each project, a set of 5 candidate documents obtained by an automatic pre-process.
The dataset includes the judgment of 4 annotators and there should be 3 annotations for every document. The annotations are combined in the Aggregate column. Use the values of this column as
the target labels to train and test you models.

1.The train accuracy of model is 0.9231800766283524

2.The test accuracy of model is  0.9367521367521368



# Application

In the Application.py file, I applied trained model on document_records_with_column_names data file, contains 14,635 titles. I paired two titles on it and got 100 millions of title pairs.  I used logistic regression classifier to predict them.
